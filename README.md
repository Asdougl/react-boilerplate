# Asdougl's React Typescript Tailwindcss Boilerplate

You may be asking yourself _Why? Why create **another** react boilerplate on github?_

## Because I can

also because i configured the way _I_ like it, because everyone has _their own_ way of doing things, and this is mine.

## Why this stack?

I'm a React developer by day so react is obvious. Typescript just makes my life so much easier. Tailwind makes developing styles fast and easy so when I'm developing some project I will inevitably abandon after two weeks I at least get further than I would if I got bogged down writing repetitive CSS

## How do I use it?

Why are you on this repo? How did you get here? Regardless:

### Dev Server

```
npm run dev
```

### Build for Production

```
npm run build
```
